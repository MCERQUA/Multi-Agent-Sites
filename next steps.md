  I've successfully set up the multi-agent Claude system     
   structure with:

  âœ… Completed:

  1. Project structure created with all necessary
  directories
  2. Core scripts implemented:
    - start_session.py - Main coordinator for managing       
  agents
    - task_manager.py - Task claiming and file locking       
  system
    - cargo_daemon.py - Rust project monitoring daemon       
  3. Configuration files created:
    - agents.json - 12 agents with different
  specializations
    - tasks.json - Task templates for web and Rust
  development
    - mcp_config.json - MCP server configuration
  template
  4. Setup automation:
    - setup.sh - Automated setup script
    - install-rust.sh - Rust installation helper
    - test_setup.py - Basic functionality test
  5. Documentation - Comprehensive README with usage
  examples

  ðŸ”„ Next Steps:

  1. Install Rust: Run
  ./multi-agent-setup/install-rust.sh
  2. Configure MCP servers: Update paths and tokens in       
  the config files
  3. Install MCP servers: The official @anthropic MCP        
  servers may not be public yet, look for
  @modelcontextprotocol/* alternatives
  4. Test the setup: Run
  ./multi-agent-claude/test_setup.py
  5. Start small: Begin with 2-3 agents before scaling       
  to 12+

  The system is ready for initial testing. Start with        
  the setup script to check prerequisites and gradually      
  work through the phases.
